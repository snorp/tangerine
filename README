Tangerine is a DAAP server.  You can use it to listen to music remotely though
a number of applications, including iTunes, Banshee, and Rhythmbox.

There is a graphical tool for configuring it (tangerine-properties).  You can also edit the config file yourself (~/.tangerine by default).  A sample config, sample.conf, is included as a template.
